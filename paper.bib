    abstract="Checked C is a new effort working toward a memory-safe C. Its design is distinguished from
        that of prior efforts by truly being an extension of C: Every C program is also a Checked C
        program. Thus, one may make incremental safety improvements to existing codebases while
        retaining backward compatibility. This paper makes two contributions. First, to help developers
        convert existing C code to use so-called checked (i.e., safe) pointers, we have developed a
        preliminary, automated porting tool. Notably, this tool takes advantage of the flexibility of
        Checked C's design: The tool need not perfectly classify every pointer, as required of prior
        all-or-nothing efforts. Rather, it can make a best effort to convert more pointers accurately,
    without letting inaccuracies inhibit compilation. However, such partial conversion raises the
        question: If safety violations can still occur, what sort of advantage does using Checked C
        provide? We draw inspiration from research on migratory typing to make our second contribution:
        We prove a blame property that renders so-called checked regions blameless of any run-time
        failure. We formalize this property for a core calculus and mechanize the proof in Coq.",
